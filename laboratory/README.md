# Laboratory 👨🏿‍🔬 🧪

Where I create new scripts.

> Last update: Supports both polkadot and kusama using types from
> [v0.8.11](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.8.11).

> Note that this software and repo is highly fragile and for now needs some manual work to be kept
> up to date with new releases of the polkadot repo. See [`UPDATE.md`](./UPDATE.md) to learn how.
